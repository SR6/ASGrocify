# Grocify
 Grocery Store App

 Description: Culminating project of Android Programming to demonstrate all the semester learning. We chose to implement an app somewhat similar to any grocery store app. Users can create a profile, shop within the grocery store closest to their provided location. Using the Kroger API, we were able to provide cost and sale information for the local store, and the user can favorite their items, add things to the cart for purchase, check stock levels, logout and come back to it later. Everything would remain in the cart for a later checkout, but if an item changed price or went out of stock, the user would not be able to purchase it upon return - and in fact, the item would be greyed out in the cart indicating the state.

 We spent so much time figuring out how to get the user login information to follow the user from screen to screen, get the favorites to be selected/deselected and show up (or not) in the Favorites screen. Oh, and there was so much information available from the Kroger API that we just couldn't justify finding a space for - the compromise between information and visual clutter!
